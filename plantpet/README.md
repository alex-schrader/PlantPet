# PlantPet Simulator
This project was created by Alex Schrader, Catherine Atalig, and Dohyun Lee. Using React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML we designed a web game that allows users to take care of a plant that mimics real-life plant care. Because plant parenting has become an extremely popular hobby, especially over the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to give potential plant parents a taste of what real-life plant cultivation looks like by developing a plant simulation game that teaches users about the process and fun that goes into nurturing your own plant.

Basic duties for care include watering, providing light, and adding fertilizer, which are implemented as buttons in the game in which your plant levels up when a combination of these items are clicked a certain number of times.
