# PlantPet Simulator
This project was created by Alex Schrader, Catherine Atalig, and Dohyun Lee. Using React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML we designed a web game that allows users to take care of a plant that mimics real-life plant care. Because plant parenting has become an extremely popular hobby, especially over the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to give potential plant parents a taste of what real-life plant cultivation looks like by developing a plant simulation game that teaches users about the process and fun that goes into nurturing your own plant.
