# PlantPet Simulator
This project was created by Alex Schrader, Catherine Atalig, and Dohyun Lee. Using React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML we designed a web game that allows users to take care of a plant that mimics real-life plant care. We implemented a watering button that levels up your plant after a multiple number of clicks and a shop button that includes buttons for fertilizer and growth lights which can also increase your plant's level.
